  <!-- JS loading pattern
        1) Normal
        2) Async: fast. If two or more than scripts are independent,
         Async is suitable. In async,when one Js 
         is fetched and then execute it and so on and at the time of execution
         parsing will be stopped and after exection parsing will be started.

        3) Defer: slow. If two or more than two scripts are dependent, 
         Defer is suitable. In deffer, parsing and JS fetching goes parallely and all JS will be fetched first
        and then execute them.
